for example , assistant professor zhang ming of renmin university , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .
but i do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
let 's do this , once again , listen carefully : the diaoyu islands are whose ? are whose ? are whose ?
the united states " dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .
oh , let me explain a bit , the diaoyu islands did not ever exist . this is a misunderstanding , misunderstanding , misunderstanding heh
we should allow the existence of different opinions , the times are really different , no matter if its democracy or pan-occidentalism , neither are beneficial to china , do n't be afraid , what do you say
such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in china to elementary school textbooks having wang erxiao , and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise traitors to china among primary school students ?
in fact , the us no longer needs to use force to deal with china , they have achieved the result of defeating enemy soldiers without fighting .
this just is a specialty of modern china there 's nothing we can do
quoting the post of xiao jianjia ( num_unk ) at 10:10:11 on september 11th , num_unk , saturday
why are you still not leaving , all of you get out , ok , you wo n't go , right ? call num_unk and have plainclothes police move in , uh . ? still not dispersed , ok , it seems it wo n't work if i do n't real weapons , armed police , steel army , come on , if it does n't work , pull out the third artillery troops , fire .
in a joyful , harmonious , friendly , and peaceful atmosphere , it came to an complete ending .
take a look at north korea , that 's our country many years ago . take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
saying that someone is bribed is improper ?
it does n't matter much when you open your mouth , but how about money , do you really think china is very strong ?
you are a dragon coiling , you are a tiger crouching , it makes sense , wait for the opportunity
i 'm just taking a look
we ca n't look over the old accounts of the previous so-called anti-japanese war .
these days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense : it 's that america , through long-term bribing of the chinese intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a fifth column .
although num_unk years ago it had established relations with china , num_unk years ago it again started imposing sanctions on china , num_unk years ago it bombed a chinese embassy , num_unk years ago the south china sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it restarted its containment of china with great fanfare .
40-some years ago , the us entered vietnam with the intention of containing china ;
for fans of military affairs , fascinated with armaments , fascinated with military clothing qualities , those who wanted to become soldiers but for various reasons did not succeed , we welcome you to join military fans " alliance , qq group num_unk . those who enter the group must adhere to the system within the group - be patriotic , must modify your group business card to be consistent with the format of other people 's . this group only permits males the enter , if you do n't conform , do n't ally together with us , do n't follow the system within the group , we will ask you to please voluntarily leave the group .
china can not be so doctrine of the mean ~
what is more they are considered traitors of china , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
sweep the floor sweep the floor we are about to do cleaning , to welcome the next dawn
look at the kuomintang-communist cooperation of those years and you will know .. .
our china is a country governed with protocol . we do n't want to bother ourselves arguing with the likes of that small country ... really tmd disgusting
i 'll ask again whose the diaoyu islands are , but do n't shout loud , discuss this matter in a gentlemanly fashion
the government is incompetent to this point !
also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago complete notes on num_unk chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the ford foundation , i feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in china who are becoming treasonous are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .
just passing through , taking a look
it can compete with articles from the cultural revolution , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .
in this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit ?
i really especially hate those who are eating chinese things and drinking chinese things , but who say america is so whatever , those dogs , if america is so good go find your american illegitimate fathers
people are all selfish , reality also is often gray .
freedom of speech is relative . we need take national conditions into account .
but these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by sina blog is really preposterous !
the fifth column will make those with vested interests in the communist party terrified , it 's a good thing
in the peaceful years , creating a ruckus does n't influence everybody cooperating when it 's time for war .. .
mr. zhengqing , the things you say are quite astonishing , there possibly is a suspicion that there are fragments , even if they are a fifth column , they would n't be so bare-boned , we should allow the existence of different opinions , the times are really different , no matter if its democracy or pan-occidentalism , neither are beneficial to china , do n't be afraid , what do you say
mister , if the diaoyu islands are ours , please prove it with actions
9 . retain the right of pre-emptive strike when national security is threatened .
in the essay recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products , she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the beijing anti-pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc. .
if things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , three people create a tiger .
freedom of speech thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
this is worth pondering a little !
it wo n't be long until people are coming from all directions to the chinese court . leading the world . this is the intent of heaven .
passing through .. .
has history given us too many lessons ? , num_unk , num_unk , num_unk
3 . manufacture num_unk advanced combat aircraft of various kinds .
just passing by and taking a look . wo n't express my opinion
like in the essay a bit less hostility , a bit more harmony , she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti-pornography-and-illegal-publications drive as social hostility ;
yes . there are many slaves of foreigners . it 's time we should renovate !
taking a look
who is shouting again outside , go , all disperse , do n't gather and watch any more , things whose nature has been decided , wo n't be changed any more ?
because these days , i 've been reading part of the specialist professor blog , it would have been okay if i did n't read it , but after i read it , it made me really surprised .
i remember , 60-some years ago the us had just fought a war with china , and still threatened china with the use of nuclear weapons ;
just call them the senkaku islands , cheers , for wisely solving the diaoyu ... ah no , the senkaku islands matter , (
